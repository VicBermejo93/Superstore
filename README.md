## 🔎Insights

Although the current Revenue has ramped up with an average annual growth rate about 15%, the analysis has identified reported that the profit has experienced reductions due to patterns identified:
- 1 out of 5 states is reporting negative results (e.g., Texas only reports above 25k USD). Other States showing the same results are Ohio, Tennessee, Illinois,  North Dakota and Pennsylvania. Besides, the financial results rely on the market segment, being the final consumer segment with the greatest impact in the financial result overall.
- Product Families such as Supplies (Office Supplies), tables and Bookcases (Furniture) reported losses, meanwhile same categories providing discounts, specially for furniture subcategories are impacting directly their financial performance.
- Apart from the discount contribution, the output comparison between ship mode is giving a relationship in financial performance per category. For example, Bookcases is reporting a positive output overall when a customer chooses “same day” as delivery option, otherwise, the profit will come back as losses.

## 🚶🏻‍➡️Recommendations and Next Steps

- Addressing efforts for those customers and interactions in those states reporting the lowest financial performance.
